        <h1>MY PET</h1>

        <p>My favorite pet is a dog. HIs name is Kiddy. He is red in color. He has thick fluffy hair that i like so much. He also has dark-red mane around his neck. I like these because they make him very scary to people; thus, he is great for protection. He is also a very obedient pet. Below are a couple of things that he is so good at:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Fetching</li>
            <li>Hunting</li>
            <li>Swimming</li>
            <li>Playing</li>
        </ul>
